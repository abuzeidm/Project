										<h1>Why Do People Watch the WWE if They Know it's Fake?</h1>
											<h2>By Chris Mueller</h2>

<p>For as long as I have been a fan of professional wrestling I have been asked the same question over and over and over again, and that question is, "why do you watch wrestling? You know it's fake right?"<br></p>
Of course I know it's fake, but does that make it any less entertaining?  No.<br></p>


<p>Wrestling is entertainment at it's very best.  It contains all aspects of almost every other entertainment medium.  Action, drama, humor, infidelity, love stories, betrayal, overcoming adversity, facing tough obstacles, pain, both mental and physical, joy, happiness, and family issues are just some of the aspects of pro wrestling that make it entertaining.<br></p>

<p>To anyone who says the WWE is "fake", my response has always been, what shows do you watch that are "real"?<br></p>

<p>24, ER, Seinfeld, the Simpsons, Law and Order, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents are some of the most successful shows of all time. Are they real? No. Are they entertaining?  Yes.<br></p>

<p>For some reason, some people in the 70's and 80's still thought wrestling was real. It was not until Vince McMahon broke the fourth wall did the industry acknowledge openly that it was all scripted and set up in advance.<br></p>

<p>As a person who trained for years in martial arts, I could always tell that these people were not fighting the way a real person would fight. I never thought it was real. <br></p>

<p>I still love pro wrestling to this day for the rich, over the top characters, the experience of being able to go and sit within yards of your favorite superstars while they perform their craft, and most of all, the competitive spirit.<br></p>

<p>To anyone who has given pro wrestling a chance and did not find it entertaining, I still give you credit for giving it a chance. But the people who criticize others for watching wrestling do not know what they are missing.<br></p>

<p>There is something for everyone. Women like seeing the shirtless wrestlers just as much as the men like the bikini clad women and both sexes can enjoy the physicality of it all.  If I could meet a woman who was as big of a wrestling fan as I am, I might marry her on the spot.  I'm sure they are out there, but apparently not where I live.<br></p>

<p>I am starting to see more and more wrestlers making mainstream media appearances these days, which is very good for the sport.  Hopefully they will pull in some new fans as well as bring back some who may have left.<br></p>

<p>In closing, I would like to say that all the fans of pro wrestling know what I am talking about when I say that there is unnecessary and sometimes unrelenting ridicule of those of us who watch it simply for the fun of it, and those fans have held true to their beliefs by continuing to support their favorites in the ring.<br></p>

<p>On a side note, anyone who watches Jersey Shore and says wrestling is dumb needs to take a second look at their personal tastes because that show is single handedly dumbing down America. <br></p>
